# PCA

This code uses singular value decomposition (SVD) as a way to compute the **principal components**.
It is using the [lanscape_dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rareone0602/landscape-pictures-pca/data), you can download it from kaggle (an account is required but do not fear, it is quick and free + you might be tempted to participate to really interesting competions!).

## Set-up
1.Install `CV2` to treat images
```
pip install opencv-python
```
2. Install `glob` if you don't have it already
```
pip install glob
```
3.Download images from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rareone0602/landscape-pictures-pca/data) and put them in a folder "dataset_landscape", it must shares the same root as the code.
