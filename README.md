# PCA

This code uses singular value decomposition (SVD) as a way to compute the **principal components**.
It is using the [lanscape_dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rareone0602/landscape-pictures-pca/data), you can download it from kaggle (an account is required but do not fear, it is quick and free + you might be tempted to participate to really intersting competions!).

## Set-up
1.Install CV2 to treat images
```
pip install opencv-python
```
2.Download images from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rareone0602/landscape-pictures-pca/data) and put them in a folder "dataset_landscape", in the same root as the code.
